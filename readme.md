1. In a few sentences,  explain the structure of your project.

    In my project, I have an array of objects that contains a few book details. I created a map fucntion to generate several book lists at the begining. Then another function in which I created a new object of a new book that takes all inputs from the form, and I generated the object in an html to show it in the DOM.

     To store the new book in the local storage, I use dispache event with custom event in the new book array and call it when I want to store the new book array. That's when I created a two fnctions to mirror the inputs and store them in the local storage. And it's sort of working but it doesn't stay in the browser when I refresh, only the array is staying in the local storage. Could you please explain more in this part during the correction?

     Then the next step is to delete the item by clicking the icon in the table cell(I used table table to display this layout so I have a small problem to listen for it, instead I listened for the cell when it'sclicked, so if you just click the icon, it won't work unless you click somewhere in the td), I'm sorry for that. So far, it removes the item from th table but it doesn't remove it from the array in the LS. I tried few tips from the video to handle it but there's still a bug needed to fix.

     And the last thing I did was working on the checkbox, I tried few things too to set my conditions, but I didn't really get the idea, so it didn't turn out well.

2. If you had more time, what area of your project would you improve?

    If I had more time, I would change my css layout because it's not responsive(the table), then I would work on the deleting an item form LS too and update the array.


 3. Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

    Before I didn't understand how to use the LS, bt when I rewatched the video and I tired ti apply it, I understood more how it works.

 4. What was the most challenging part for you?

    The most chanllenging was to delete the item and update the array which I couldn't really do and understndiing how the dropdown and the checkbox relate to each other.

 5. Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?

    If it's possible, I would like more explanation about the local storage(store and delete) and the checkbox awith dropdown please.

6. Any other comments?
I really loved this project becasue there are some useful esson I need to know. I was really happy coding too.
